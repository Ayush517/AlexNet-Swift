# AlexNet in Swift #

This is an implementation of the classic <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">AlexNet</a> convolutional neural network architecture in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift">Swift for TensorFlow</a>.

It currently builds and runs on both the Mac (via an Xcode project) and on Ubuntu 18.04 (via the `swift build` command in the main directory).
